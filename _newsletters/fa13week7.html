					<b>More Opportunities:</b>
					<p> Home for the Holidays is a volunteer based charity that provides assistance to active duty military personnel stationed in the San Diego region, by uniting them with their loved ones at important times (holidays, sickness, death, birth, etc.) <br /> <br />
					Their existing site <a href="http://www.homefortheholidays.org/">www.homefortheholidays.org</a> is functional, but does not allow the charity to maintain and update the site internally, nor maximize it as a fundraising tool. They are looking for help redoing their current website to create an equivalent or better site on an easy to manage platform.  <br /> <br /> If you are interested in taking this on as a project or have questions or comments you can reach Michael Geremia at (916) 284-4289 or by email (mikegeremia@gmail.com).
