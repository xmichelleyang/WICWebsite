              Lucy is a fourth-year majoring in Computer Science with a specialization
              in bioinformatics. Since she joined in her first year, WIC has given her
              invaluable opportunities within the CS community and has proved to be a
              fantastic support group. Outside of CS, Lucy plays soccer and enjoys
              cooking/eating, photography, and the outdoors. She recently returned
              from studying abroad in Copenhagen.

            <h4> Jessica Yang </h4>
            <p>
              Jessica is a fourth-year Computer Science major.  Her passion in
              computer science stems from the unlimited applications of programming
              to different areas of interests. When she first joined WIC freshman year,
              she was simply looking for a community to be a part of; she ended up
              staying because of the people she's met along the way and because she
              became increasingly passionate about the cause. Outside of programming,
              Jessica likes to watch TV shows, play video games, try new foods, and crochet.

              UCSD and has successfully completed several summer internships at companies of various
              sizes. Her academic pursuits place her at the most innovative crossroads between
              computer science, biotechnology, and consulting. She hopes to use these experiences to
              further WiC's goals by inspiring growth, networking opportunities, and overall learning
              through her contributions as treasurer for the 2016-17 academic year. She's always

            Qiqi is a third-year Computer Science Major. She was initially dawn
            to the major because of her interest in technology, and the infinite
            possibilities that a computer can offer. She joined WiC because she
            wanted to meet other members who share the same passion in the field.
            Her goal is to empower other students to succeed and to encourage
            inclusion in computing. When she is not stuck in the lab, Qiqi enjoys
            watching movies, reading, shopping, and going to the beach.

        <p>Vrushali is a third-year undergraduate computer science major at UC San Diego. She
           took an interest in computer science thanks to a programming class in her high school,
           and hopes to encourage other high school girls to develop a passion for the subject by
           reaching out to them through various events hosted at UCSD. She joined WIC to connect
           with other people with similar interests and to become a part of the incredible CS
           community, and so part of her other time is spent in bringing together students
           interested in CS through socials and other fun activities. Outside of CS, she loves

        <p> Vivian is a third-year Computer Science Major at UCSD. Her first taste of Computer
          Science was by pure chance, having selected a high school CS elective on a whim. From
          there, she was hooked on the logic and problem solving skills associated with the
          field. Outside of CS and programming, she enjoys drawing and being a huge foodie.

            with computers at a young age. As a Marshallite, Michelle is passionate about
            feminist issues, especially the lack of women in STEM. Consequently, Michelle brings
            a computer and pepper-spray everywhere she goes, ready to smash the glass ceiling.
            A hard worker, Michelle loves to surround herself with fellow strong individuals
            and found Women in Coding to be the perfect environment. In her free time,
            Michelle likes to rock climb, hike, skateboard, film videos, take/edit photos,
            sew, and learn new things.

              opportunities. She likes to stay involved on campus and really enjoys
              encouraging more girls to pursue engineering and CS. She spent this past
              summer working as an instructor at an all-girls summer tech camp called
              Alexa Cafe. Barbara is currently a tutor for CSE 30 and a writing tutor
              at the UCSD Writing Hub. During her free time, she enjoys going to the beach,

        <p> Christopher is a first-year Computer Engineering major. He joined
            WIC and applied to the officer board for the chance to get to know
            new people at UCSD, learn about clubs on campus, and to promote
            opportunities for women. Inspired by the effect of Girls Who Code
            on friends in high school, he hopes to spread positive change in
            the field of computer science. Outside of CS, Chris enjoys
            cooking and eating delicious foods, running on a track, and
            reading.
